# MARIE Assembly Code Collection

This repository contains a collection of MARIE assembly language programs, written and commented by Mauricio Emilio Monroy Gonz√°lez (A01029647) and others. The programs demonstrate a variety of fundamental programming concepts using the MARIE architecture, a simple educational computer architecture widely used for teaching computer organization and assembly programming.

## üìÇ Folder Contents

- **Addition Calculator.txt**  
  Simple program to add two numbers input by the user.

- **Calculo Y = X - 2A - 3B - 4C.txt**  
  Calculates the value of `Y = X - 2A - 3B - 4C` using input values.

- **CondEq.txt**  
  Demonstrates conditional execution: if-else logic for comparing two values.

- **DuplicateNum.txt**  
  Duplicates the value of two numbers and outputs the results.

- **Inversion de 4 Localidades de Memoria.txt**  
  Reverses the contents of four memory locations.

- **Longitud de String.txt**  
  Calculates the length of a string stored in memory.

- **Multiplication Calculator.txt**  
  Multiplies two numbers using iterative addition and handles negative numbers.

- **Recursive QuickSort.txt**  
  Implements the QuickSort algorithm recursively, demonstrating advanced stack and memory management.

- **Sum5Nums.txt**  
  Sums five numbers stored in memory.


## üßë‚Äçüíª Programming Concepts Demonstrated

- **Input/Output Operations:**  
  Reading from and writing to the console using `Input` and `Output` instructions.

- **Arithmetic Operations:**  
  Addition, subtraction, and multiplication (via repeated addition).

- **Loops:**  
  Implemented using labels and `Jump`/`Skipcond` instructions for repeated execution (e.g., summing numbers, multiplying, or traversing memory).

- **Conditional Execution:**  
  Using `Skipcond` and `Jump` to implement if-else logic and comparisons.

- **Memory Management:**  
  Direct and indirect addressing, storing and loading values, and manipulating pointers for advanced algorithms.

- **Subroutines:**  
  Use of `JnS` (Jump and Store) for calling subroutines, as seen in multiplication and recursive QuickSort.

- **Stack Usage:**  
  Manual stack management for recursive algorithms and local variable storage (notably in QuickSort).



## üìù Usage

These programs are intended for use with the [MARIE Simulator](https://www.marietools.com/) or any compatible MARIE assembly environment.  
To run a program:
1. Open the `.txt` file in your MARIE simulator.
2. Assemble and run the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts for input and observe the output.
